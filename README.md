# 🧠 AI Research Logs

A structured repository documenting my deep dive into AI research papers — one paper at a time.

Instead of passively reading papers, this repo focuses on active understanding, critical analysis, and developing research intuition.

Each paper is broken down using a consistent framework to build clarity, depth, and originality in thinking.

## 📌 Paper Breakdown Format

For every paper, I document:

### 1. Problem Definition  
What exactly is the paper trying to solve?

### 2. Why Prior Methods Fail  
What were the limitations or bottlenecks in earlier approaches?

### 3. Key Innovation (1–2 lines max)  
What is the core idea that makes this paper important?

### 4. Core Equation Explanation  
Clear intuition and breakdown of the main mathematical formulation.

### 5. Experimental Setup  
Datasets, model configurations, training setup, optimizer details.

### 6. Limitations  
Practical, theoretical, or scalability weaknesses.

### 7. 3 Research Questions to Explore Further  
New directions, extensions, or open problems inspired by the paper.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

Reading research papers is not enough — understanding and questioning them is what builds research capability.

This repository helps me:

- Identify gaps in existing work  
- Develop strong mathematical intuition  
- Generate novel research ideas  
- Prepare for research and collaborations

## 🚀 Long-Term Goal

Transition from:

**Reading papers → Reproducing ideas → Asking strong research questions → Contributing original work**

This repository is the foundation of that journey.
